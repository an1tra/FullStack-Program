        <div id="bio">
        
            
            <p>Linkin Park (formed in 1996) is an American nu-metal band that has won two 
            Grammy awards and sold over fifty million albums worldwide.</p>

            <p><strong>The Formation:</strong> Linkin Park was originally formed by Mike Shinoda, Brad Delson 
            and Rob Bourdon, who all knew each other from high school in California. After graduation, Joe Hahn, 
            Dave 'Phoenix' Farrell and Mark Wakefield joined the band. At the time, the band was known as Xero.</p>

            <p>Xero recorded their demos in Shinoda's bedroom but failure to secure a record deal caused tensions in 
            the band. Mark Wakefield (the vocalist at the time) and Dave Farrell both left the band.</p>

            <p>Chester Bennington was drafted in as Wakefield's replacement. He was formerly the singer for Grey Daze 
            and his distinctive vocal style stood out. The band changed their name to Hybrid Theory for a short time 
            but the addition of Bennington to the band brought a new chemistry and they changed names again to 
            Linkin Park: a homage to Lincoln Park, in Santa Monica.</p>

            <p>Although a record deal remained elusive for some time, they eventually signed to Warner Bros. in 1999.</p>
